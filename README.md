# DevOps Roadmap Journal

This repository documents my self-learning journey into **Linux, Web Fundamentals, DevOps, and Cloud**.  
The structure follows a topic-based approach, where I track my progress through each subject at my own pace.

## Structure
- `journal/` → Topic-based learning folders (e.g. `linux-basics/`, `master-markdown/`)
  - Each topic contains `notes.md` (main learning content) and `exercises/` (hands-on practice)
- `templates/` → Reusable templates for documentation (personal drafts for my private use only)

## Goals
- Build a strong foundation in Linux, scripting, Git, and cloud
- Document progress clearly and consistently
- Use this repo as both a **learning aid** and **portfolio proof**
