# DevOps Roadmap Journal

This repository documents my self-learning journey into **Linux, Web Fundamentals, DevOps, and Cloud**.  
The structure follows a topic-based approach, where I track my progress through each subject at my own pace.

## Structure
- `journal/` → Topic-based learning logs (e.g. `linux-basics.md`, `docker-fundamentals.md`, `git-basics.md`)
- `projects/` → Small practice labs or experiments (e.g. setting up a web server, automating tasks)
 
## Goals
- Build a strong foundation in Linux, scripting, Git, and cloud
- Document progress clearly and consistently
- Use this repo as both a **learning aid** and **portfolio proof**
