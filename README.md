# DevOps Roadmap Journal

This repository documents my self-learning journey into **Linux, Web Fundamentals, DevOps, and Cloud**.  
The structure follows a weekly log, where I track what I studied, hands-on practice, and notes.

## Structure
- `journal/` → Weekly notes (e.g. `week-01.md`, `week-02.md`)
- `templates/` → Reusable templates for daily logs // Ignored folder in .gitignore
- `projects/` → Small practice labs or experiments (e.g. setting up a web server, automating tasks)
 
## Goals
- Build a strong foundation in Linux, scripting, Git, and cloud
- Document progress clearly and consistently
- Use this repo as both a **learning aid** and **portfolio proof**
