# Master Markdown & Documentation

**Started:** Sep 9, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Estimated completion:** Sep 16, 2025

## Study Log

### Day 1
Got introduced to Markdown, a super simple way of formatting text without dealing with heavy HTML. It’s all about using symbols like # for headings, * for lists, > for quotes, etc.

---

### Day 2
Explored core Markdown syntax and practiced everything in one doc. Key bits I used:
- Headings: `#` to `######`
- Emphasis: `*italic*`, `**bold**`, `~~strike~~`
- Lists: `-` unordered, `1.` ordered, `- [ ]` tasks
- Links & images: `[text](https://...)`, `![alt](img.png)`
- Code: inline ``code`` and mention of fenced blocks
- Tables: `| col | col |` with `:---` alignment
- Blockquotes: `>` quote lines
- Horizontal rules: `---`, `***`, or `___`


Wrote a [readme-exercise](exercises/01-readme-exercise.md), using headers, lists, links, code blocks, and tables.

**Quick thoughts:** [WIP: As easy it might seem, mastering Markdown takes practice and patience. I feel more confident now in creating well-structured docs, but it's still a journey.]
